| Detect, Distill and Update: Learned DB Systems Facing Out of Distribution Data                      | Meghdad Kurmanji, Peter Triantafillou                                     | This paper presents a learning framework called DDUp for detecting OODs and updating learned database components. A statistical test is used to test the hypothesis that the new data obey the same distribution as the learned model.

| **Fine-grained Partitioning for Aggressive Data Skipping**                                          | Liwen Sun, Michael J. Franklin, Sanjay Krishnan, Reynold S. Xin           | This paper presents a feature based partitioning framework. A number of features are selected to calculate a feature vector for each tuple. The conjunction of all feature vectors in a block is used for data skipping. And data are partitioned to maximize the data skipping gain. The contributions are (1) a workload analyzer, which generates a set of features from a query log, (2) a partitioner, which computes a blocking scheme by solving a optimization problem, (3) a feature-based block skipping framework used in query execution.                                                                                                     | SIGMOD 2014                               | Partitioning, NP-Hard                                                 |

It add Join-induced Predicates into QD-Tree. Effectively it should perform better than single table optimization. But Join-induced Predicates also poses a challenge when new data are added or old data are updated. Join-induced Predicates need to be refreshed and adjusted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | SIGMOD 2021                               | QD-Tree, Sideways Information Passing, Instance-Optimized Data Layout |

The authors observe that there are query skew and data correlation which pose challenges to both tranditional multi-dimentional indices and Flood. This paper invents two structures - Grid Tree and Argumented Grid. Each structure is constructured as an optimization problem. The authors also formulate the optimization goals.                                                                                                                                                               | PVLDB Vol 14, No. 2, 2020                 | Learned Index, Multi-dimensional Index, Skewed Workload               |

This ssystem employs a proactively compaction srategy to move cold data to slow media. The authors claim that they can reduce tail latency by up to 78.9% using SA-SLM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | PVLDB Vol 15 Issue 10, 2022               | LSM-Tree, Survival Analysis, Random Forest                            |
| Tiresias: Enabling Predictive Autonomous Storage and Indexing                                       | Michael Abebe, Horatiu Lazu, Khuzaima Daudjee                             | This paper presents the Tiresias method which combine workload prediction and autonomous storage and indexing. The authors introduce how to predict future workoad and estimate plan cost under a specific storage layout. They also give a heuristic method to calculate the benefit of employing a storage change. Though this paper doesn't say how to propose a storage change I guess they should have a small fixed set of storage choices to select from.                                                                                                                                                                                          | SIGMOD 2021                               | Autonomous Storage, Indexing, Workload Prediction                     |
| Stochastic Database Cracking: Towards Robust Adaptive - Indexing in Main-Memory Column-Stores       | Felix Halim, Stratos Idreos, Panagiotis Karras, Roland H. C. Yap          | This paper extends the origional idea of database cracking by introducing stochastic cracks. The origional database cracking only cracks a column exactly based on data predicates. This paper shows that for sequential workload the origional cracking method has no optimization compared to random workload. In order to address this problem this paper propose two different algorithms - DDC and DDR. The difference is that DDC always tries to cut in the center which requires a cost of finding the median, but DDR chooses to cut randomly. They also devise other variants with more lightweight initial cost based on these two algorithms. | PVLDB 2012                                | Database Cracking, Column Store, Adaptive Indexing                    |

The authors show how to encode a table as one feature instead of using a column-wise feature, and how to combine these two tasks in one model. But they didn't answer why the order of row and column values seem doesn't matter too much in their tests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | SIGMOD 2022                               | Large Language Model, Column Annotation, Column Clustering            |
| Learning a Partitioning Advisor for Cloud Databases                                                 | Benjamin Hilprecht, Carsten Binnig, Uwe Rohm                              | This paper shows how to use DRL to find the optimized horizontal partititoning for a cloud database. The authors first use a cost model to train the DRL offline, then refine the training online. To further reduce the training time they use sampled dataset instead of full dataset, and runtime caching and maximum runtime capping techniques.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | SIGMOD 2020                               | Deep Reinforcement Learning, Partitioning, Learned Model              |
