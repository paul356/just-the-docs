| An End-to-End Learning-based Cost Estimator                                                          | Ji Sun, Guoliang Li                                                                                         | This paper shows a cardinality and cost estimation method which takes trees of query plans as inputs and give the estimation of the query cost and cardinalities. The authors show how to encode query operators, predicates, metadata, sample bitmaps into vectors. These vectors go through a embedding method, then through an estimation network to give the estimation of query costs. An abolation study is conducted to show the effectiveness of string embedding choices, the tree structure model and bitmap sampling.                                                                 | PVLDB Vol 13, November 2019   | Representation Learning, Long Short-Term Memory, String Embedding, Query Cost Estimation, Tree Structure Model |

| Language Models Enable Simple Systems For Generating Structured Views Of Heterogeneous Data Lakes    | Simran Arora, Brandon Yang, Sabri Eyuboglu, Avanika Narayan, Andrew Hojel, Immanuel Trummer, Christopher Re | This paper presents EVAPORATE a framework which utilize LLM to extract and organize data from raw documents. The authors compare three methods - direct, code, and code+. The direct method prompts LLM to extract and organize data directly from documents. The code method prompts LLM to generate code to extract and organize data. The last method also use generated code to extract and orgnaize data, but it uses weak supervision to vote result from many candidate functions. The last one gives the best result and makes a balance between cost (tokens consumed) and performance. | PVLDB Vol 17, October 2023    | Large Language Model, Data Extraction, Function Generation                                                     |
