| Language Models Enable Simple Systems For Generating Structured Views Of Heterogeneous Data Lakes         | Simran Arora, Brandon Yang, Sabri Eyuboglu, Avanika Narayan, Andrew Hojel, Immanuel Trummer, Christopher Re              | This paper presents EVAPORATE a framework which utilize LLM to extract and organize data from raw documents. The authors compare three methods - direct, code, and code+. The direct method prompts LLM to extract and organize data directly from documents. The code method prompts LLM to generate code to extract and organize data. The last method also use generated code to extract and orgnaize data, but it uses weak supervision to vote result from many candidate functions. The last one gives the best result and makes a balance between cost (tokens consumed) and performance.         | PVLDB Vol 17, October 2023    | Large Language Model, Data Extraction, Function Generation                                                     |
| How Good Are Query Optimizers, Really?                                                                    | Viktor Leis, Thomas Neumann, etc.                                                                                        | This paper investigates how query optimizers perform on cardinality estimation, cost estimation, plan enumeration, and it shows how these query optimizers perform on a more realistic dataset. Based on experiments the authors find that cost model errors are dwarfed by cartinality estimation errors, and estimation errors increase along with the number of join relations. Dynamic query plan optimization during query execution can effectively counteract bad query plans. This paper shows the effectiveness of different design considerations and suggests worthwhile research directions. | PVLDB Vol 9, 2015             | Query Optimizer, Cardinality Estimation                                                                        |
