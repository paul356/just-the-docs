| The R\*-tree: An Efficient and Robust AccessMethod for Points and Rectangles+                | Norbert Beckmann, Hans-Peter Kriegel, Ralf Schneider, and Bernhard Seeger            | R-Tree is a popular tree structure for managing spatial shapes. In the origional paper [Gut84](http://www-db.deis.unibo.it/courses/SI-LS/papers/Gut84.pdf). The origion algorithm is framed that minimum area increase is set as the only criteria. But it is showed in some cases the origional algorithm will generate bad results. Reconsider the criterias of a R-Tree with optimal retrieval performance this paper introduces a new algorithm for steps ChooseSubTree and QudraticSplit. The result show it can improve the retrieval performance and robustness at the cost of slightly increasing the insert cost. | SIGMOD 90      | R-Tree                                                                      |
| ALECE: An Attention-based Learned Cardinality Estimator for SPJ Queries on Dynamic Workloads | Pengfei Li, Wenqing Wei, Rong Zhu, Bolin Ding, Jingren Zhou, Hua Lu                  | ALECE is another learned based cardinality estimator which learns from true cardinalities. It takes featurized data distribution and queries as input. With two attention structures, one self attention for data features and one cross attention between data features and query features, it can achieve much better estimate than competitors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | VLDB 2023      | Cardinality Estimation, Attention                                           |
| The Transaction Concept: Virtues and Limitations                                             | Jim Gray                                                                             | This technical report introduces where transactions evolves from. It also introduces the general transaction model, and how to implement transactions. Two methods are time-domain addressing and logging and locking. It also discusses some of the issues with current transaction implementations, for example, nested transactions and long living transactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Tandem TR 81.3 | Transaction, Time-Domain Address, Logging and Locking                       |
| A Critique of ANSI SQL Isolation Levels                                                      | Hal Berenson, Phil Bernstein, Jim Gray, Jim Melton, Elizabeth O'Neil, Patrick O'Neil | This technical report redefine the isolation levels defined by ANSI SQL standards. It add the missing phenomena **Dirty Write** and fix the loose phenomena defintions. Result is a new table for isolation levels, Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable. Plus it also introduce the other isolation levels, and how to achieve Serializable with Snapshot Isolation + First Committer Wins strategy.                                                                                                                                                                                           | SIGMOD 1995    | Isolation Level, Snapshot Isolation, First Committer Wins                   |
| An Overview of Query Optimization in Relational Systems                                      | Surajit Chaudhuri                                                                    | This paper extensively review the optimization problems in database research. It first starts with an example of System R optimizer. It then covers the optimization space issues, including Join Reorder, Pull Up and Push Down of Group By, Merging Views and Sub-queries. It then discuss the issues about Statistics Collecting and Cost Estimation. It then gives two example enumeration architectures, Starbust and Volcano. Lastly it briefly metions the challenges with distributed systems, UDF and Materialized Views.                                                                                         | PODS 98        | Query Optimization, Query Plan Search, Cost Estimation, Select Project Join |
